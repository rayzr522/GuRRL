# GuRRL
Golang using Real Radioactive Lasers - a simple Discord bot that I made so I could learn about [Go](http://golang.org). It only has a few commands right now.

## Download
I will do my best to keep the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/GuRRL/releases) up to date with executables in as many platforms as I can.

If you want to manually build this yourself, just [install Go](https://golang.org/dl/), clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
go build -o dist/main main.go
```

For those of you on ***nix** operating systems, you can run the `build` script that comes with the code. It executes the command shown above.

## Running
Just run the built file and provide it with a token:

```
main -t "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
```
